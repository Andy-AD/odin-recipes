    <h3>Filipino Style Chicken Adobo</h3>
    <p>For starters, what is chicken adobo? ⇢ Great question! Chicken adobo is a traditional dish of the Philippines. It
        consists of braising chicken in a blend of soy sauce and vinegar along with aromatics like garlic, peppercorns,
        bay leaves, and more. The taste is salty, vinegary, slightly sweet, and tangy with bits of heat. Filipino
        chicken adobo is a fairly straightforward and simple recipe to make.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4-5 boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>4-5 chicken drumstick</li>
        <li>12 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped scallions, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white distilled vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>jasmine rice, for serving - <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces (thighs + drumsticks), crushed garlic, scallions, peppercorns,
            brown sugar, rice vinegar, distilled vinegar, soy sauce, and bay leaves together. Use your hands (fitted
            with disposable gloves, if desired) to massage everything together- make sure all of the chicken is
            submerged.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours,
            preferably overnight- because we’ll need this later on, do not discard the marinade!
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large dutch oven or braiser/heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, coat the bottom of the pot with 1
            tablespoon of oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a few pieces of chicken out of the marinade, shaking off any excess aromatic bits, and place into the
            hot pan. Careful not to overcrowd the pan, work in batches. Sear the chicken on all sides until lightly
            browned/crisp, about 2-3 minutes per side. Then place the seared chicken pieces onto a large plate/baking
            sheet and set aside. Repeat this process until all of the chicken has been browned, coating the pan with
            more oil, as needed in between batches.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once all of the chicken has been browned and is set aside, add the reserved marinade directly into the pot
            along with all of the aromatics- leave nothing behind. Let the marinade come up to a slight boil and then
            immediately reduce the heat to low.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the browned chicken pieces back into the pot, spooning a bit of the marinade over the chicken. Then
            cover the pot with a lid and let the chicken simmer for 30 minutes. Once done, uncover the pot and carefully
            flip chicken pieces over, basting the chicken with the marinade once more. Cover the pot and let the chicken
            simmer for another 25- 30 minutes. At this stage, the sauce should have thickened and developed into a more
            glaze-like texture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the bay leaves and serve the chicken adobo with sauce on top of jasmine rice, and garnish with
            scallions, if desired. Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
